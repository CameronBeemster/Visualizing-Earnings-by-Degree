# Visualizing Earnings by Degree

Hello! Thank you for checking out my project.

This notebook is for a project I did while learning data science/analytics with <a href='https://www.dataquest.io'>Dataquest</a>. The goal of this project was to practice exploratory data visualization. The dataset is on the job outcomes of students who graduated between 2010 and 2012. It is from American Community Survey, which surveyed and aggregated the data. <a href='https://github.com/fivethirtyeight'>FiveThirtyEight</a> cleaned the dataset.
